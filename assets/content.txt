--- -But really, why are you especial?
---Yes we know, you are asking yourself that.
---Well the bad thing is that we are not especials at all, in the other hand the good thing is we are not afraid of say 'no, i am busy', or 'no, i cant do that', or simply 'i dont wanna do it'. Why is this good?. Again, our hope is to create a comunity, so doesn't matter what you want, we are close to you and are't going to lie, and will put maximun effort. We really love solve problems, and learn along the way, so, we are waiting.
